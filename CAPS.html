        <h2>Individual Peer Counseling</h2>

        <h3>Benefits of Peer Counseling</h3>
        <p>Peer counseling can offer students a relaxed and laid back place to vent and find support. We are able to listen and relate, as well as give you a judgment-free space to talk out your thoughts. Students have reported appreciating having someone outside of their immediate circle to talk to as well as someone who is able to support them in working through personal challenges.</p>
