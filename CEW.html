            <h3>CEW+ awards scholarships</h3>
            <p>CEW+ scholarships are awarded to nontraditional undergraduate students at the University of Michigan who have experienced a lapse of one year or more in their education. Scholarships are awarded on the basis of financial need, academic merit, and a clear indication of how the individual plans to use their education to give back to the community.</p>
